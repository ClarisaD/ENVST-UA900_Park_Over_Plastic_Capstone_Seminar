## Assignment Guidelines

As with all written work, proofread for spelling and grammar. This is where working as a team will come in handy.

Any work that you will turn in, should always contain the following:

* Date
* Your first and last name
* Park Over Plastic Capstone Seminar
* Spring 2020
* Diaz



I will check your class blog for assignments, looking at when and what you post. Student blogs for this class are listed below:
