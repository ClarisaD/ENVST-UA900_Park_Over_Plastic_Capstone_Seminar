# Final Project

### Spring 2020 • Clarisa Diaz • Mondays • 5:00-7:30pm • Washington Square SILV 402

## Final Project

Working in groups of two, you will combine ideas, research, analyze, evaluate, and communicate a designed product, set of visualizations or other media experience for Park Over Plastic. The final will also include user testing on how effecte your deliverable is, and a systems map on how your deliverable can be used by the Hudson River Park Trust.

### Annotated Bibliography

You will write an annotated bibliography as a team. I recommend using google docs to collaboratively write. The bare minimum of sources is ten. You will be graded based on the thoroughness of your research.  You should have many different types of sources in your bibliography.  These sources should have an impact on the work you create.

Using [Purdue OWL Annotated Bibliography Guidelines](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/614/01/), summarize, assess, and reflect.

* The Wikipedia Disclaimer: Nowadays, wikipedia is often the starting point for research – it’s quick, easy, and provides an acceptable overview of many subjects. However, for serious, sustained research Wikipedia should not be relied upon as a primary source. Use Wikipedia to familiarize yourself with your subject and to locate other sources for further research.
