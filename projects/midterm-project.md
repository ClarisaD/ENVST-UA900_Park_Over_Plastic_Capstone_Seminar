## Midterm

Working individually, you will research, analyze, and evaluate climate change stakeholders and current systems in Dar es Salaam. You will then propose 3 ideas of what would be interesting for you to solve, based on your research. The final result is a series of user profiles, the connections between them and systems maps of how risk communication works in Dar es Salaam, along with the 3 ideas in visual form.


### Annotated Bibliography

You will write an annotated bibliography. The bare minimum of sources is ten. You will be graded based on the thoroughness of your research.  You should have many different types of sources in your bibliography.  These sources should have an impact on the work you create.

Using [Purdue OWL Annotated Bibliography Guidelines](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/614/01/), summarize, assess, and reflect.

* The Wikipedia Disclaimer: Nowadays, wikipedia is often the starting point for research – it’s quick, easy, and provides an acceptable overview of many subjects. However, for serious, sustained research Wikipedia should not be relied upon as a primary source. Use Wikipedia to familiarize yourself with your subject and to locate other sources for further research.
